# Iterator Design Pattern Project

## Overview

Software design patterns are programming paradigms that describe reusable solutions to common design problems. They offer a standardized approach to solving issues in software design, acting as templates that can be adapted to specific situations. Design patterns are not direct implementations or algorithms, but rather conceptual tools that guide software architecture, ensuring consistency, reusability, and clarity in design decisions. They also facilitate communication among developers by providing a common language for discussing solutions.

This project demonstrates the **Iterator** design pattern, which is a behavioral pattern used to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. The Iterator pattern decouples the traversal process from the collection itself, providing a standard way to iterate through various collections in a consistent manner.

## Design

This project defines a custom collection of `Employee` objects. The collection is managed by a `ConcreteCollection` class, which allows the addition of new employees. To navigate through the collection, the project implements a `ConcreteIterator`, adhering to the Iterator design pattern. The iterator provides methods to traverse the collection, offering functionality to access the first, next, and current elements, and check if the traversal is complete.

### Classes

- **Employee**
  - Represents individual elements within the collection.
  - **Properties:**
    - `Name` (string): The name of the employee.
    - `ID` (int): The unique identifier for the employee.

- **IAbstractCollection**
  - Defines the interface for the collection to create iterators.
  - **Methods:**
    - `Iterator CreateIterator()`: Creates an iterator for the collection.

- **ConcreteCollection**
  - Implements the `IAbstractCollection` interface and manages the collection of `Employee` objects.
  - **Methods:**
    - `void AddEmployee(Employee employee)`: Adds an employee to the collection.
    - `int Count { get; }`: Gets the number of employees in the collection.
    - `Employee GetEmployee(int index)`: Retrieves an employee by index.
    - `Iterator CreateIterator()`: Creates a `ConcreteIterator` for the collection.

- **Iterator**
  - Defines the interface for iterators, including methods for navigation and checking traversal completion.
  - **Methods:**
    - `Employee First()`: Returns the first employee in the collection.
    - `Employee Next()`: Returns the next employee in the collection.
    - `bool IsCompleted { get; }`: Indicates whether the iteration has completed.

- **ConcreteIterator**
  - Implements the `Iterator` interface and provides the logic for traversing the `ConcreteCollection`.
  - **Fields:**
    - `_collection` (ConcreteCollection): The collection being iterated.
    - `_currentIndex` (int): The current position in the iteration.
  - **Methods:**
    - `Employee First()`: Initializes and returns the first employee.
    - `Employee Next()`: Advances to the next employee and returns it.
    - `bool IsCompleted { get; }`: Checks if the end of the collection has been reached.

## Real-World Applications

The Iterator pattern is widely used in scenarios where collections of objects need to be traversed without exposing the collectionâ€™s structure. Some common applications include:

- **Collections in Data Structures**
  - Providing a uniform interface to traverse different types of collections like lists, trees, or arrays.

- **File Systems**
  - Navigating files and directories without exposing the underlying file system structure.

- **User Interface Components**
  - Iterating through UI components, such as menus or toolbars, allowing flexible navigation without coupling the UI logic to a specific component structure.
